    Run experiments that drive activation, retention, collaboration, and revenue, partnering with design, data science, and research.

    Build internal tools and platform improvements that help all engineers ship quickly and safely.

Skills You’ll Bring

    Proven track record of execution: You have a minimum of 1 year (and up to 3 years) of full-time professional engineering experience, including building world-class product experiences as part of an engineering team. You have solid fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems, with a product-minded, pragmatic approach to solving problems.

    Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity successfully, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.

    Impact-driven approach to technology: You see technologies as tools to achieve user impact rather than ends in themselves. You care more about building successful systems that solve real problems than about using specific tech stacks or following trends. You stay current with the latest tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI-assisted development environments, you're pragmatic about choosing the right tool for the job, focusing on what delivers the most value to users and the business.

    Proactive communication and high agency: You own your work, communicating clearly about progress and blockers. You don't wait for instructions for every step but rather show initiative in identifying what needs to be done and driving projects forward. You ask questions when needed while independently finding solutions to problems.

Nice to Have

    Experience with parts of our stack like React, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, or with experimentation and analytics tooling.
